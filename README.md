The goal of this project was to build a social networking application with 
a focus of learning more about database even handling. The app uses the Python Flask micro framework and SqlAlchemy Object Relational Mapper.

Another goal of this project was to practice reading code (Miguel Grinberg from flaskbook) and being able to work with, understand, and extend an existing code base.
